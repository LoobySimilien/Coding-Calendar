# Coding-Calendar


This was a personal creation for my Project Code class.
It exhibits the HTML5 and CSS3 taught.  

Because the class didn't cover JQuery, I completed a MOOC tutorial and applied a few uses of that JavaScript library.

This calendar is for all those addicted to coding.  

It will offer surprises for each day of the month (coding jokes, coding events, and coding historical facts).

I will add code to it as time progresses.  Enjoy the prototype for now.
